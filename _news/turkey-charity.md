One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself *transformed* in his bed into a horrible  [vermin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin "Wikipedia Vermin"). He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover **strong** it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, link waved abouthelplessly as he looked. <cite>“What's happened to me?”</cite> he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.

## The bedding was hardly able to cover it

It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm disappeared..

### Things we know about Gregor's sleeping habits

- He always slept on his right side.
- He has to get up early (to start another dreadful day).
- He has a drawer and a alarm clock next to his bed.
- His mother calls him when he gets up to late.
