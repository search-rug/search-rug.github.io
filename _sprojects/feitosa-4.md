title: 'Are Code Review Bots dealing with Self-Admitted Technical Debt?'
types:

Technical Debt (TD) refers to non-optimal decisions that are made during software development (e.g., create a workaround for a problem) [1]. Sometimes, TD items are self-admitted, i.e., developers document the existence of such TD in places such as code comments, issue trackers, and pull requests [2, 3]. Also, it is possible to use bots in the code review process to automate some tasks, e.g., provide feedback to contributors and manage data collected from other tools (such as SonarQube) [4]. Hence, some SATD (self-admitted TD) items may have been manipulated by code review bots.

The goal of this project is to explore to what extent code review bots are dealing with SATD Items in the context of open-source software (OSS). To that end, you will work in an empirical study, mainly based on mining software repositories (e.g., hosted on GitHub) to extract SATD items documented in issues and pull requests. Thus, this project involves collecting and analyzing data using different tools and frameworks (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks, R Studio, and others).
