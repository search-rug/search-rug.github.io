DESCRIPTIONGrammars are an essential component of many meta programming scenarios, such as static analysis, mass maintenance, and refactoring. In this project the goal is to obtain a high quality Rascal grammar from the Swift language reference, in a (semi-)automatic, traceable way. In particular, we're interested in the grammar transformation steps needed to go from a "documentation" grammar, to a grammar that can be used for parsing.
