Technical debt (TD) refers to non-optimal decisions that are made during software development (e.g., create a workaround for a problem) [1], and sometimes, it is documented using issue tracking systems [2]. In such systems, general-purpose bots can be used to automate some task (e.g.,open, close, and comment), which could benefit and support the management of TD. Nonetheless, since general-purpose bots do not provide specific support for TD management, it is still necessary to extend them or develop new bots.

To enable such extensions, a deeper understanding of the rationale behind those tasks (i.e., the functionalities provided by the bots) is still necessary. This information can provide useful hints on why (and how) developers use such bots, and support the elicitation of requirements for bots focused on TD management.

The goal of this project is to identify and classify the functionalities of general-purpose bots that can be used as drivers for enhancing the support for TD management. The student can expect to work in an empirical study, mainly based on mining software repositories (e.g., hosted on GitHub) and grounded theory [4]. Thus, this project involves collecting and analyzing data using different tools and frameworks (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks, R Studio, and others), as well as qualitative analysis (e.g., coding).
