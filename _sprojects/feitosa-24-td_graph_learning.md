Technical debt refers to suboptimal decisions made by developers while writing software. Too much technical debt can cause the code to become difficult to maintain. As such, it is important to manage the amount of technical debt in a project. One of the steps involved in this process is actually identifying the technical debt.

In recent years, neural networks and deep learning have become popular. One particular development is the emergence of graph neural networks, which are neural networks which operate on graph data. Such neural networks have been applied on graph representations of code (e.g. ASTs) for vulnerability detection.

The goal of this project is to select techniques previously used for vulnerability detection from literature, apply them in the technical debt setting, and check whether these techniques are also successful in detecting technical debt in existing technical debt datasets.
