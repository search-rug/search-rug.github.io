### About the project
The Klippa platform allows our users to automate their business processes.
We have multiple services focused on extracting data from documents and returning these in
a structured format.
On top of this we provide the service of no code automation; the Klippa flow builder. It allows
our users to connect standard automation to our Klippa services. It is similar to products like
Zapier or Make.com.
Example flow for automation of document extraction
1. New Email is received
2. Email is checked for attachment
3. If there is an attachment then, the document is extracted by our model.
4. Extracted data is added to an existing google sheet.

###  The assignment
We have lots of components already (which can be checked by signing in to the platform).
But we need to find a direction in adding components.
1) Which external components are interesting to add for our business (intelligent
document processing)? External components can be
2) Scope how many can be done in the project period
3) Add them to our flow builder in our platform.
