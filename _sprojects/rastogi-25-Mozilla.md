Mozilla Firefox is a widely used open-source web browser worldwide. As the software continues to grow in size and complexity, the big question is how to improve software quality faster. 

Previously, we found that one way to improve quality without compromising speed is to assign code reviews to groups rather than individuals [1]. This opens up new questions: 

1. Why and how group code reviews improve software quality?
2. How do review practices impact the workload of experts? 

Each question is a master's thesis that will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Marco Castelluccio from Mozilla Foundations.

**Skills learned**: problem solving, scientific thinking, data science, machine learning, and scientific writing.

**Available spots**: 2
