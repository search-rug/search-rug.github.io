The goal of this project is to investigate the topics discussed by developers in various artifacts generated by open source projects. This includes discussions between developers in different  communication channels such as emails, issues in issue trackers, pull requests, and irc (internet relay chat). This also includes information from comments and commit messages.

This topic can be used for **multiple projects**, each focussing on a different type of artifact. Possible artifacts: emails, issues/pull requests, irc, commit messages, comments
