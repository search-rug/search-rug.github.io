Mozilla Firefox is a widely used open-source web browser worldwide developed. As the software continues growing in size and complexity, the big question is how to serve users better, and by better, we mean faster.

The goal of this project is to identify the current turnaround time before code reaches the user, where there is a bottleneck, and what can be done to improve it. This master thesis project will be conducted in collaboration with Marco Castelluccio from Mozilla Foundations.
