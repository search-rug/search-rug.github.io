How are recommender systems biased against minorities? Code review recommenders are designed to get work done faster and better. It would be interesting to see how our quest for speed and quality drives opportunities away. I have linked a few articles substantiating the field, the long-term consequences, and initial studies to understand the fairness landscape of code reviewer recommendations.
