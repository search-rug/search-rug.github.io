description: Design and implement a web-based frontend for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) learning assistant. The goal is to provide students with an intuitive interface to interact with course materials through conversational queries. Collaborate with the Digital Lab team to deliver key views, incl. a login screen, a multi-modal chat screen, a review screen, and a content management screen.

The aim of this project is to create a clean, responsive front‑end for a RAG system that helps students explore course material through conversational interaction. Students can pose natural‑language queries, and receive synthesized answers drawn from curated lecture notes, slides, and assignments.

Key deliverables include four distinct UI screens, each built with modern React (hooks, functional components, and TypeScript) and styled via a component library such as Material‑UI or Tailwind CSS:

- Login Screen – Secure authentication integration with clear error handling and accessibility support.
- Student Interaction Screen – A chat‑style interface where learners type or speak queries, view streamed responses, which can be rated by instructors. The layout must accommodate multi‑modal content (text, code snippets, diagrams).
- Review Screen (TA/Instructor) – Enables teaching assistants or lecturers to inspect conversation logs, flag inaccurate outputs, and annotate responses with additional explanations or references.
- Coordination Screen (Content Management) – Provides a dashboard for curators to upload, tag, and version control reference documents (PDF, PPT, Google Docs). It should expose bulk‑import utilities and visual status indicators for ingestion pipelines.

You will work closely with the Digital Lab team to iterate on UI prototypes, and incorporate feedback into successive sprints. The project emphasizes clean component architecture, and state management.
