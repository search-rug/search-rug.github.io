As Lehman's first law of software evolution states: a [...] system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory". With software systems shaping humans, it is increasingly important to understand their evolution.
There are many parts of this project, offering interesting and challenging opportunities at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence. This project will harness the ability to gather signals from data to infer meaningful insights and inform decisions.
