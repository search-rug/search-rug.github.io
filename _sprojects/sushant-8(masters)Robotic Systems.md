Robotics software systems are large, distributed, and highly configurable. A single robot platform may support multiple hardware configurations (e.g., sensors, actuators, degrees of freedom) and deployment contexts, leading to significant **software variability**. Today, this variability is managed manually through configuration files, conditional logic, and ad-hoc architectural decisions, making robotics software difficult to understand, configure, and evolve.

This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE)**—in particular **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—can assist developers in **analyzing, reasoning about, and managing variability** in robotics software systems. Robotics software (e.g., ROS-based systems) serves as a realistic and challenging domain for studying AI-assisted software analysis due to its distributed architecture, configuration complexity, and strong hardware–software dependencies.

The student will investigate how AI models can:
- Identify variability points in robotics codebases and configuration artifacts.
- Assist developers in selecting valid software configurations for specific robot setups.
- Explain architectural dependencies and constraints induced by different configurations.
- Support evolution tasks such as adapting software when hardware components change.

The project is **software engineering–driven**: the focus is on program analysis, configuration reasoning, architectural understanding, and developer support, rather than on robot control or hardware implementation.

**This project contributes:**
- An AI-assisted approach for discovering and documenting variability in robotics software systems.
- Empirical evaluation of LLMs for configuration reasoning and architectural explanation tasks.
- A prototype tool that supports developers in configuring and evolving robotics software.
- Insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs for complex, configuration-heavy software systems.

Robotics knowledge is **not required**. The project emphasizes software analysis, AI-assisted reasoning, and empirical evaluation using real-world software repositories.
