Despite the growing narrative around diversity and inclusion in the tech field, the industry has yet to fully translate opportunity into inclusion for disabled professionals working in these roles. This project explores the impact of the recently introduced AI-powered tool GitHub Copilot on the productivity of self-identified disabled developers on GitHub. 

**Skills learned:** problem solving, scientific thinking, data science, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and scientific writing.

**Available spots:** 1
