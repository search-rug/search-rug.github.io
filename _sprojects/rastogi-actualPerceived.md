**Project Description: Deducting Developer Origin, Residence, and Perceptions**  

This project focuses on deducing developers' origin, current residence, and perceived geographic identity using data-driven methodologies. By leveraging publicly available data and developer surveys, the research aims to analyze patterns of migration, local versus global representation, and the alignment between developers' actual and perceived locations. Key objectives include identifying trends in developer mobility, understanding regional influences on software contributions, and exploring biases related to geographic perceptions. The findings will provide actionable insights to enhance inclusivity, mitigate bias, and promote equitable participation in the global software development ecosystem.
