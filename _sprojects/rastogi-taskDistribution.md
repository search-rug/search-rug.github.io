The vision of this project is to measure how software development is changing in current times. 

Hypothesis 1: Software code is changing faster than developers can review it.

Hypothesis 2: Adopting AI-powered tools has increased development velocity but not review velocity.

[Bonus; Optional] Hypothesis 3: The widening gap between development and review velocity will negatively influence code quality. 

Testing the above hypotheses requires an understanding of (a) how to design an experiment? (b) statistical tests for analysis, (c) infer metrics from data, and (d) somewhat understanding of natural language processing.
