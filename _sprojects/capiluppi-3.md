### About the project
LabeBook is an online handbook that provides researchers with comprehensive, highly structured, and
validated information on experimental methods in Life Science. The prototype of the platform is under
development.Currently, life science researchers face serious difficulties in finding information on experimental
methods. A large amount of information has been accumulated, but it is difficult to extract what is
needed because there are no mechanisms to personalize queries. There is also no rigorous validation
process for published material. The problem has therefore evolved from one of time-consuming
information retrieval to a global reproducibility crisis. Existing online solutions continue to accumulate
information, but do not provide algorithms to solve the problems described.
LabeBook provides the scientific community with a rational approach that significantly reduces the time
for information retrieval and ensures the validation process.

This project is to be executed as an exploratory case study in collaboration with LabeBook BV. A monetary compensation will be handled directly to the student.
