This project aims to design and validate methods to infer developer demographics, such as gender, experience levels, geographic distribution, and collaboration patterns, from development activity data. The ultimate goal is to uncover insights that can support equitable and inclusive software development practices.

This project is in collaboration with [Prof. Mei Nagappan](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~m2nagapp/) from the University of Waterloo.

**Available spots**: 2

### Literature
1. She elicits requirements and he tests: Software engineering gender bias in large language models.

2. Relationship between diversity of collaborative group membersâ€™ race and ethnicity and the frequency of their collaborative contributions in GitHub

3. 'Patches don't have gender': What is not open in open source software
